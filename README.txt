How to play:

You need to eat, sleep, and drink water in order to survive. 
Pulling the lever spawns resources but costs other resources (such as H2). 
You can assemble parts to the air recycler, open the drawers, and otherwise interact with the elements of the game in order to try to survive.
You can sleep by lying down on the floor (the screen fades to black).
